This project is the culmination of my Node.js and Express.js course at Code The Dream. The application is designed to help users organize and manage information about their music and movies effectively. Built with Node.js, it utilizes Express.js for routing and server-side functionality, offering a streamlined way to categorize, store, and access entertainment data. This project demonstrates practical skills in backend development and API creation.
